This is a version of the [countries api](https://github.com/kiprop-dave/countries-api) that I had already built. However, this one uses Next.js. I built it as a way of learning next.js

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
